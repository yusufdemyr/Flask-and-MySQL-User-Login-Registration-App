# Flask-and-MySQL-User-Login-Registration-App

This project is a simple user login and registration application developed using Flask web framework and MySQL database. A website is created where users can register and login, and their login and registration details are validated.

The application is developed using Flask web framework and Flask-MySQLdb extension. User account details are stored in a MySQL database, and login and registration processes are validated. The application stores user passwords using a simple encryption method, but a more secure authentication method is recommended for a real-world application.

To run the project, you need to create a database named "login" and create a table named "accounts" with username and password fields. The table structure is a simple table with username and password fields. Before running the application, you need to modify the username and password for the MySQL connection.

This project is created to serve as an example for developers who want to develop a simple application using Flask web framework and MySQL database.
